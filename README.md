Bookmarklets are bookmarks which run javascript into a site. You can use these to temporary modify a site. 


To use these bookmarklets there are two ways. 

First: Copy the code from the bookmarklet you want. Go to the search bar and delete the URL. Type "javascript:" then paste the code right after it. 

Second: Go to your bookmarks. Double click and press add page. Press save. Double click the bookmark then paste the code without "javascript:" then press save. To use the bookmarklet press on the bookmark.
